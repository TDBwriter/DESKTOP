Any mating ritual that slowly burns until both know that they have reached an understanding where they both want to be with each other, whatever happens after that nexus, is good sex. 

When you roam free, the ritual is a lengthly dance to woo and court and consummate, but when you really like to be with that person, and you work well together and enjoy each others company, you can reduce elements of the dance. Speed up the process. Go forth boldly with understanding and trust established.

Just not to much. Never everything. Never choice. Never collaboration. 

That's not good sex.
