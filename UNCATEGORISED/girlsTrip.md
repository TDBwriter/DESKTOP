Friends need to do a job and hilarity ensues. It's a guy and a girl, and the guy is trying to convince the girl he could be one of the girls. She tries to girl trip it up as fuck and he absorbs it like a champ. It's fucking funny. Probably played by Emma Stone and the guy who was so good with Eva from Training Day. If he was a character like Christian from Clueless. Ha fucking ha. Or a nerd who is cool doubles with sexy lesbians.
