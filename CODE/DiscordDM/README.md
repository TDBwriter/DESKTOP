# DiscordDM

## Overview
DiscordDM is a chatbot designed for Discord channels that enables character interaction with NPCs inside a designated location. Each room is represented as a separate chat channel.

## Features
- **NPC Interaction**: The chatbot can act as up to five NPCs in a given location.
  - One or two fixed roles (e.g., librarian, shopkeep, barmaid).
  - Generic patrons autogenerated to act within the environment.
- **User Actions**: Users can perform three main actions:
  - **Act**: Perform actions within the environment that can affect all users in the room.
  - **Speak**: Communicate using the character's voice.
  - **Muse**: Share thoughts or internal monologues, or describe actions that do not directly affect others.
- **Altercations**: Users can engage in altercations with each other.
  - All altercations result in a timeout for the user in that chat for "recovery."
  - Recovery time is calculated as one minute for each hit point lost.

## Use Cases
- Enhance role-playing experiences in Discord servers.
- Provide immersive environments for storytelling and collaborative games.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the variety of fixed roles and autogenerated patrons.
- Add customization options for NPC behavior and dialogue.
