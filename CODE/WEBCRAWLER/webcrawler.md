# Guide to Building a Web Crawler

## 1. Define the Scope
- Decide the depth of crawling (e.g., how many links deep to follow).
- Set rules to avoid crawling restricted or sensitive areas (e.g., respect `robots.txt` files).

## 2. Choose a Programming Language
- Python is a popular choice for web crawling due to libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Scrapy`.

## 3. Build the Crawler
- Fetch web pages using HTTP requests.
- Parse the HTML to extract links and other data.
- Follow links recursively while avoiding loops.

## 4. Store the Data
- Use a database or file system to store the discovered URLs and metadata.

## 5. Handle Challenges
- Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading servers.
- Handle CAPTCHAs and other anti-bot measures.

## 6. Visualize the Map
- Use graph visualization tools (e.g., `NetworkX` or `Graphviz`) to represent the connections.

## Saving Information in JSON Data Trees

To save information collected about each server in JSON format, you can organize the data as follows:

### JSON Structure
```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "server_name": "example.com",
      "operating_system": "Linux",
      "location": {
        "network": "192.168.1.1",
        "geographical": "New York, USA"
      },
      "robots_txt": "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /private/"
    },
    {
      "server_name": "anotherexample.com",
      "operating_system": "Windows",
      "location": {
        "network": "192.168.1.2",
        "geographical": "London, UK"
      },
      "robots_txt": "User-agent: *\nDisallow: /sensitive/"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Steps to Implement
1. **Collect Server Information**:
   - Use network scanning tools (e.g., `nmap`) to identify servers and their operating systems.
   - Use geolocation APIs (e.g., `ipstack`) to determine the geographical location of servers.

2. **Fetch `robots.txt`**:
   - For each server, send an HTTP request to `http://<server_name>/robots.txt`.
   - Save the content of the `robots.txt` file.

3. **Organize Data**:
   - Store the collected data in a structured JSON format as shown above.

4. **Save to File**:
   - Write the JSON data to a file (e.g., `servers.json`) for later use.

### Example Code in Python
```python
import requests
import json

def fetch_server_data(server_name):
    try:
        # Fetch robots.txt
        response = requests.get(f"http://{server_name}/robots.txt")
        robots_txt = response.text if response.status_code == 200 else "Not Found"

        # Example data (replace with actual network and geolocation data)
        server_data = {
            "server_name": server_name,
            "operating_system": "Unknown",  # Replace with actual OS detection
            "location": {
                "network": "Unknown",  # Replace with actual network location
                "geographical": "Unknown"  # Replace with actual geolocation
            },
            "robots_txt": robots_txt
        }
        return server_data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching data for {server_name}: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
servers = ["example.com", "anotherexample.com"]
server_data_list = [fetch_server_data(server) for server in servers]

# Save to JSON file
with open("servers.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump({"servers": server_data_list}, file, indent=4)
```

This script collects server information, fetches `robots.txt` files, and saves the data in a JSON file.
