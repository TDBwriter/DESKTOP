A dog can understand you as well as you can understand him.
We are limited in our abilities to refer to our relationships with animals, because we can still only choose the gender pronouns of he or she.
I do not always want to be so explicit with my pointed description as to quantify with "female dog" but I also don't want to have to say she and you be unclear if I mean the dog.
Hmmm...I wonder if the similarities between dogs and humans can be shown in how the same behaviors in female dogs (excessive vocalization of desires), their shared tenacity for getting what they want, and female humans (repetition and dissection of qualifiers) combine to create the reason we can no longer use the concept of "bitch" as a pronoun...
I bet it was the canines who developed the negative connotations first.
Fucking bitches.

If the major failure point of any individual firing system is the heat accumulated in the barrel, why don't we use separate systems? One that feeds the projectile, and one that feeds the propellant. By using separate reloadable ammunition systems, we can at least increase the volume of fire down the barrel...no, gains would be negligible: powder still explosively expands in the rounds wake, regardless or it's origin, and the barrel would heat. The real problem isn't with volume of fire anyway, it's with accuracy and understanding our need to kill it.
