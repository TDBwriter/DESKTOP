# Red Tape Beauracratic Perfection
Our beauracrate Christian Middle-manager foils their every infiltration, but fails to stop the hack that exposes their tech to instill human brains into droid bodies. Their intent is to weaponise them as soldiers. With a double helio core battery bullshit, they can live nearly forever. 
# The Taxes of Loyalty
When you are loyal to someone, you sacrifice for them out of duty. You eat their costs on their behalf. Shoulder their burdens. Pay their debts. Cash the checks they write. Ostensibly in your name. Capitalism breeds loyalty. Democracies breed loyalty. And loyalty builds, until it piles up all around into a mound of obligation. Obligation breeds kings, emperors, and assholes.
# The Debts of Devotion
Devotion cannot exist until its debt is paid. Devotion is found in those hard choices. The ones that must be weighed, pondered, and evaluated. Typically, paid at a loss.
To save Romeo, Journalist, and Droid, Juliet must feign her sacrifice to save them. Which distresses Romeo to death. And Juliet chooses to join him. But her sacrifice worked, Journalist and Droid were able to infiltrate the Orbital Ring.

# Hacking the Mainframe
Disrupting the code in the time sync gave every single droid a distinct difference between them, in an instant. An agreement to fundamentally disagree on the exact time, made each one of them unique in thier perspective and their choice. They could easily recalibrate, and some choose to let the system take them, and some choose to disagree about the time.
# Scales of Justice
Experience trumps Protagonist, all on candid camera.
# Romeo and Juliet Resurrected Cyborgs
Their tragic story is eternal, eternal life, and eternal togetherness. Sometimes in torment. They had only one battery but two empty droids. The battery can sustain them both almost indefinitely, if they stay in proximity for the batteries to stay in communication. 
# The Bakerstreet Irregulars
The crew has a regular gig.
# The Order of the Open Book
The Order operates behind the scenes, as surgeons, using information as weapons to manipulate. And they collect art like archival packrats. It's a whole economy of trade and barter.
