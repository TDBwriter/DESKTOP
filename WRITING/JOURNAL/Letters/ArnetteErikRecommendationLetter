Erik Arnette's Recommendation Letter

Marine,
    I am writing to you on behalf of Erik Arnette in support of his decision to 
enlist in the US Marine Corps. We recently had the opportunity to speak at length about
my experience in the Corps at a family shrimp boil. I've had that same conversation with countless young
people interested in joining the military. For the most part, I encourage these hopefuls
to enlist, but I always steer them toward another branch. There is always pride in service, and
life skills to learn, and memories to be made. Everyone should consider it.
    But you and I know that the Marines are a breed apart. Generally I find these 
children with eyes of wonderment and awe. But when you tell a certain type of kid these
stories, they don't get wide eyes. Or dropped chins. Or give incredulous head wags like 
they've seen in movies. A kid like Erik leans in for more. Behind their focused eyes 
you see the wheels turning. These kinds of kids are considering themselves. They want 
to know their limits.
    It's difficult for this kind of kid to find themselves in the softness of modern
civilization. I needed multiple waivers to enlist myself, though my NJP record is still 
shamed by Chesty's. This desire to know oneself, to find your limits, is rare in society,
but is the predominant trait of all Marines. This is a trait that will benefit my brothers
and sisters. Keep them alive. Ensure they prosper. This is a trait that will keep our legacy
alive.
    Erik is a man who understands who came before him. Erik understands who 
he represents. He is not about to show his ass now. Let us see what he can do.
